# Recursive Exponentiation

This Python program calculates the result of raising a base to an exponent using a recursive approach. The program ensures proper input validation, requiring the exponent to be a whole number between 2 and 50.

## **Features**
1. **Recursive Exponentiation**:
   - Implements a recursive method to calculate `base^exponent` efficiently.
   - Uses the base case where any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Ensures the exponent is a whole number between 2 and 50.
   - Prompts the user to re-enter the exponent if the value is out of range.

3. **Interactive Output**:
   - Displays the result of the computation in a clear and formatted message.

## **How to Run**

### **Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required.

### **Steps**
1. Save the program as `recursive_exponentiation.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the program.
4. Run the program:
